= Help Text Syntax Specification

== 1. Command Sections

Lines starting with one or more `=` define a command and start a new help section.

* `=`       - Top-level help (shown when no command is given or `--help` is used)
* `==`, `===` etc. - Subcommands and deeper levels

A brief description may follow the command after a dash (`-`), ignoring whitespace:

----
== add - Add a new item
----

== 2. Option Groups

You can define reusable groups of options:

----
@group common
    -v, --verbose        Enable verbose output
    -q, --quiet          Suppress output
----

To reuse them in a command section:

----
@include common
----

== 3. Options Section

A section starts with:

----
Options:
----

Each option line can include:

* Short name (e.g. `-v`)
* Long name (e.g. `--verbose`)
* Parameters (in angle brackets)

Optional types can be added as `<name:type>`:

----
-s, --source <file:string> <mode>
----

Either short or long name may be omitted.

== 4. Subcommand Listing

Use the macro `$(subcommands)` to automatically insert a list of direct subcommands (and their summaries) for the current section.

Example:

----
$(subcommands)
----

Will render:

----
  add     - Add something
  remove  - Remove something
----

== 5. Text Formatting

AsciiDoc-style markup is supported:

* `*bold*`
* `_italic_`
* `[underline]#underlined#`
* `[green]#colored text#`

Rendered using ANSI escape sequences if the terminal supports them.

== 6. Comments

Lines starting with `#` are comments and ignored.

To include a literal `#`, escape with backslash: `\#`.

== 7. Pre-section Text

Text before the first `=` section is ignored for help rendering, but may contain banner text or `@group` definitions.

== 8. Options and Parameters Parsing Rules

* Option sections may be multiline (continuation by indentation).
* Parameters are tracked per option.
* Options are grouped using the `@group` mechanism and matched by command path at runtime.
